Welcome to my academic personal website! I am a researcher at **Fudan University**, specializing in the intersection of **Electron Microscopy**, **4D-STEM**, and **Deep Learning**. 

My research focuses on overcoming the computational bottlenecks of high-resolution imaging to enable high-throughput materials characterization at the atomic scale.

Research Interests
======
*   **Electron Ptychography:** Developing next-generation phase retrieval algorithms to push the limits of spatial resolution.
*   **Scientific Machine Learning (SciML):** Leveraging deep learning to accelerate physics-based inversions and iterative solvers.
*   **High-Throughput 4D-STEM:** Optimizing data-intensive workflows for real-time atomic mapping and analysis.

Current Work
======
Currently, my work addresses the scalability challenges in **Electron Ptychography**. While ptychography routinely achieves sub-ångström resolution, the high computational cost of traditional iterative engines (like ePIE) often limits its application to small areas.

I have developed a **Deep Learning-based decoupling framework** that:
*   Achieves **over 1,000× acceleration** compared to conventional iterative methods.
*   Maintains **physical fidelity** by strictly preserving the physical resolution limits and diffraction information.
*   Ensures robust **generalization** across different material systems without the risk of "AI hallucinations."

This work paves the way for giga-pixel atomic imaging and real-time feedback during electron microscopy experiments.

Selected News
======
*   **[2025.05]** Our latest work on fast phase retrieval has been submitted for peer review.
*   **[2025.01]** I am preparing for the **PICO 2026** conference to discuss the physical limits of AI-driven ptychography.

Education
======
*   **Fudan University**, Shanghai, China
    *   College of Intelligent Robotics and Advanced Manufacturing
*   **Collaborative Research**
    *   Actively collaborating with researchers from National Tsing Hua University and The University of Sydney on advanced 4D-STEM algorithms.
